//////////////////////////Hello dear team!//////////////////////////////

Here is my attempt to complete the task I received after passing the first interview.

In the assignment you are asking me to use: React/Next.js, TypeScript and scss.

To be honest, I have not worked with Next so far, and in order to meet the deadline, I wrote the project without using this framework.

Nevertheless, I have learned enough material about it and am ready to try to rewrite all my code using Next.js. 
I'm honestly interested, because I believe that I can master it.

The style is implemented using the scss.
I haven't used any additional libraries other than "styled-components" in one component, though I prefer MaterialUI.

I created components based on the scope of the task - not a very complex branching but not very crumpled so that you can easily navigate if necessary.
You can go through 4 pages in total:
*login
*login confirmation
*forgot password
*registration

I tried to make the code as clean as possible, but I'm sure that there are still places where it can be improved.

I hope you will like my work and I will be able to continue to work with you.
